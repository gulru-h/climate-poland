Hello! Welcome to the GitHub page for Study 2. 

## Here you will find:

### R-Project:
1- climate_pol.Rproj

### Data files:
1- corrected_data_preliminary_cleaned.csv   <br/>
2- corrected_data_preliminary_cleaned.sav  <br/>

### Script:
1- final-poland_v3.R

## If you would like to replicate the analyses:
Open the file "climate_pol.Rproj" in RStudio. After opening the file, the renv package will ask if you would like to download and install all the packages the project needs by running `renv::restore()`. This will create the same environment in which we ran our analyses.
